Title: Odin Recipes 

This is a my first HTML project from The Odin Project(https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

Skills Demonstrated:
linking of webpages (relative linking)
embedding images into webpages
using appropraite of order for list(ordered, unorderd)
using conventionals git commits

Reflection:
it's easy to commit as you code rather than committing everything at the end
